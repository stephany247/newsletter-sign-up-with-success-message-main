### What I learned

Hereâ€™s the section filled with actual code from the form project:

What I Learned
Working through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several key concepts and techniques that helped me improve my front-end skills. Here are some of the major takeaways:

1. Responsive Design with TailwindCSS:
   I enhanced my ability to create responsive layouts using TailwindCSS. By utilizing classes like sm:m-auto, sm:w-full, and sm:flex, I ensured that the layout adjusted seamlessly across different screen sizes.

```html
<body
  class="font-roboto sm:bg-Dark_Slate_Grey text-Dark_Slate_Grey sm:text-sm w-full h-screen m-0 p-0 sm:my-auto sm:flex sm:flex-col sm:place-content-center"
>
  <main
    class="gap-4 bg-white mx-0 max-w-screen-md sm:p-6 sm:m-auto sm:p-auto sm:m-auto sm:rounded-3xl"
  ></main>
</body>
```

2. Form Validation and Error Handling with JavaScript:
   I implemented client-side form validation to ensure users provided accurate information. This taught me how to validate form inputs dynamically and display appropriate error messages.

```js
if (!isValidEmail(emailValue)) {
  emailError.textContent = "Valid email required";
  emailError.classList.remove("hidden");
  emailInput.classList.add("border-tomato");
  emailInput.classList.add("bg-pink-200/50");
  return;
}
```

3. Working with Inputs and Styling Using TailwindCSS:
   I applied TailwindCSS classes to style input fields and buttons for a polished user interface. Using classes like border-gray-300, hover:bg-blue-600, and focus:outline-none, I ensured that the elements were both visually appealing and user-friendly.

```html
<input
  class="border border-Grey p-4 mb-6 rounded-lg focus:border focus:border-Dark_Slate_Grey invalid:border-tomato invalid:text-tomato invalid:bg-pink-200/50 focus:invalid:border focus:invalid:border-pink-500 focus:invalid:border-pink-500"
  type="email"
  name="email"
  id="email"
  placeholder="email@company.com"
/>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus on improving advanced form validation techniques, such as real-time validation, custom error messages, and integrating libraries like Yup or Formik for more efficient handling.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - I found helpful solutions for CSS issues, like handling hover effects and box shadows, which were crucial for implementing the card design in this project.
